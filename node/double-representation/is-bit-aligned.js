/**
 * Returns true if the given number is bit-aligned in the sense that its a
 * multiple of a given power of 2, say e, and such that the number, say a,
 * conforms to: a/2^e < 2^(l-e), where l is the max allowed bit length.
 * This essentially means the numbers act somewhat like fixed-point numbers
 * which can drastically speed up some geometric algorithms and also reduce
 * their complexity.
 *
 * Visually:
 * These numbers (a,b and c) are grid aligned with e === 3 and max
 * bitlength === 6:
 *   a -> 00|101100|000
 *   b -> 00|000100|000
 *   c -> 00|110111|000
 * These are not
 *   a -> 01|101100|000
 *   b -> 00|000100|000
 * These are not
 *   a -> 00|101100|000
 *   b -> 00|000100|100
 * These are not
 *   a -> 00|101100|100
 *   b -> 00|000100|100
 * @param as An array of numbers to check
 * @param maxBitLength The max allowed bitlength
