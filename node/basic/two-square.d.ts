/**
 * Returns the exact result of squaring a double.
 *
 * * the resulting expansion is least significant double first.
 *
 * Theorem 18 (Shewchuk): Let a and b be p-bit floating-point numbers, where
 * p >= 6. Then the following algorithm will produce a nonoverlapping expansion
 * x + y such that ab = x + y, where x is an approximation to ab and y
 * represents the roundoff error in the calculation of x. Furthermore, if
 * round-to-even tiebreaking is used, x and y are non-adjacent.
